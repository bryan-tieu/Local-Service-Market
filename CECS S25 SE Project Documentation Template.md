### Purpose

The purpose of this project offers an application to provide a worker profile that lists requirements and information for the employer. Requests are evaluated and job listings are viewed by the employer.
### 

### Audience

The intended audience of this document includes project stakeholders, developers, testers, and anyone involved in the project lifecycle.

## 

## Introduction

The goal is to provide and receive a service from both employers and workers and rate eachother to ensure credibility. It aims to solve by viewing eachother's profiles as a way to validate credentials for its intended hired services.
(Introduce the software project, its goals, and the problem it aims to solve)

### 

### Project Overview

"Local Services Market" is a web based user-interface system as user profiles for employers and workers based on matching geographic locations. It lists all types of required skills, job postings, contact information, and ratings. 

### Project Goals

* create an appealing and functional UI for profile accounts

* Updates real time profile information accounts

* A simple search engine based on geographic location to match profile accounts between employers and workers

* functional rating page user-interface
## 

## Glossary


* **LSM**: An abbreviation for Local Service Market, which is the system that users interact with to access our services.

## User Requirements and Use Cases

(Outline what the system must do from the user's perspective. User stories need to use the format discussed in class and on our slides. Use cases provide detailed scenarios of system interactions.)

### 

### User Stories

1. As an employer, I want to be able to post jobs for workers to find and accept.

2. As a worker, I want to be able to access earnings and see if payments are processed or completed.

3. As an employer, I want to be able to see the progress on a job to ensure my job is being completed on time.

4. As an employer, I want to be able to securely set up a payment system to ensure my workers are paid on time.

5. As a worker, I want to be able to leave reviews so that corrupt or bad employers do not hire new workers or scam anyone else.

6. As an employer, I want to be able to leave reviews so good workers are recognized for good work.

7. As a worker, I want to be able to search jobs that match my skills/experience to ensure I am able to do a job properly.

8. As an employer, I want to be able to search for workers in my area to ensure my jobs are sufficiently scheduled.

9. As a worker, I want to be able to communicate with employers so that I can perform the job correctly.

10. As a worker, I want to be able to customize my profile to ensure that my resume accurately displays my skills/experience.
