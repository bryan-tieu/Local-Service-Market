### Purpose

The purpose of this project offers an application to provide a worker profile that lists requirements and information for the employer. Requests are evaluated and job listings are viewed by the employer.
### 

### Audience

The intended audience of this document includes project stakeholders, developers, testers, and anyone involved in the project lifecycle.

## 

## Introduction

The goal is to provide and receive a service from both employers and workers and rate eachother to ensure credibility. It aims to solve by viewing eachother's profiles as a way to validate credentials for its intended hired services.
(Introduce the software project, its goals, and the problem it aims to solve)

### 

### Project Overview

"Local Services Market" is a web based user-interface system as user profiles for employers and workers based on matching geographic locations. It lists all types of required skills, job postings, contact information, and ratings. 

### Project Goals

* create an appealing and functional UI for profile accounts

* Updates real time profile information accounts

* A simple search engine based on geographic location to match profile accounts between employers and workers

* functional rating page user-interface
## 

## Glossary

(Define key terms and acronyms used throughout the document, unless they are commonly known to each possible stakeholder (e.g., “Cell phone”) AND used with their common meaning. Do not expect your stakeholders to be experts. If in doubt, define a term.)

* **Inventory**: The stock of products available for sale.

* **SKU**: Stock Keeping Unit, a unique identifier for each product.

* **API**: Application Programming Interface.

## 

## User Requirements and Use Cases

(Outline what the system must do from the user's perspective. User stories need to use the format discussed in class and on our slides. Use cases provide detailed scenarios of system interactions.)

### 

### User Stories

(A collection of user stories that apply to the project.)

1. As a registered user, I want to log in securely so that I cannot be held responsible for someone else’s actions.

2. As an inventory manager, I need to add new products to the inventory so that the database matches the physical inventory.

3. As a sales manager, I want to generate sales reports by date range so that the upper management can be kept up to date on the company’s performance.
